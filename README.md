# Build your dream team with Autogen
   
This repo helps you to build a team of AI agents, this code is setting up a system of agents using the autogen library. The agents include a human admin, an AI Developer, a planner, an executor, and a quality assurance agent.
Each agent is configured with a name, a role, and specific behaviors or responsibilities.
