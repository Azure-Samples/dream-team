# Build your dream team with Autogen

This repository leverages Microsoft Autogen 0.4, Azure OpenAI and integrates it with Streamlit, to build an end to end multi agents application, this repo makes it easy to build test and deploy an advanced multi agent framwork, based on [Magentic One](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/articles/magentic-one-a-generalist-multi-agent-system-for-solving-complex-tasks/)

:tada: December, 2024: The repo now support one click deployment with [Azure Developer CLI] (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/), if you would like to run it with the full process localy you can check [v0.21](https://github.com/yanivvak/dream-team/tree/v0.21)

:tada: November 18, 2024: we are porting this repo to  [Autogen 0.4](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.4.0.dev6/index.html), A new event driven, asynchronous architecture for AutoGen and [Magentic One](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/python/packages/autogen-magentic-one)

# Prerequisites:

1. Install [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd?tabs=winget-windows%2Cbrew-mac%2Cscript-linux&pivots=os-windows).
2. Ensure you have access to an Azure subscription.

# Step by Step Deployment
   
## 1. Clone the repository     
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/yanivvak/dream-team.git  
```
## 2. Login to your Azure account
```bash
azd auth login
```

## 3. Deploy Azure Resources and the app
```bash
azd up
```

# Working localy  
```bash  
cd src 
```

Set up a virtual environment (Preferred)
```bash
python -m venv dream
```
Once youâ€™ve created a virtual environment, you may activate it.

On Windows, run:
```bash
dream\Scripts\activate
```
On Unix or MacOS, run:
```bash
source dream/bin/activate
```
To deactivate :
```bash
deactivate
```
> More information about virtual environments can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)

 
## Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/microsoft/autogen.git 
cd autogen/python/packages/autogen-magentic-one
pip install -e .
```

```bash
playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

## Update configuration

   - If you used AZD to deploy the resources just run `azd env get-values > .env` in the `src` directory
   - Alternatively, copy `.env.sample` (under src) into `.env`

> Magentic-One code uses code execution, you need to have Docker installed to run the examples if you use local execution

# Run
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
